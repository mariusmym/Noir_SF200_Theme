# How to "install" the theme:

-insert sd card to PC

-**backup resource folder first** (just in case anything happens or you want it back to stock design)

-copy the downloaded files from the Resources folder (if the readme file is included in the download dont forget to not include it in the transfer to froggy)

-paste & replace inside Resource folder of SD Card.

- insert the SD card back to your SF2000.

# User editable files 

I also included the editable **.psd** files, so you can easily modify the images and further customize the theme to match your preferences. Some layers are a little messed up, but you can figure them out eventually. Shapes and text are not rasterized, so you can change the colors more easily.

Each **.psd** file comes with a matching **.png** preview, so you can quickly see what itâ€™s about.
