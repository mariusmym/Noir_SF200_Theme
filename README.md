# Noir_SF200_Theme
Theme for Datafrog SF2000, withdark colors, inspired by garlicOS theme by Zerter.

# How to "inslall" theme:

-insert sd card to PC

-backup resource folder first (just in case anything happens or you want it back to stock design)

-copy the downloaded files from the Resources folder (if the readme file is included in the download dont forget to not include it in the transfer to froggy)

-paste & replace inside Resource folder of SD Card.

- insert the SD card back to your SF2000.

# User editable files 

I also icluded the .psd editable files, so you can easly modiffy the images in order to further customize the theme to match your preferences. 
All .psd files have a .png matching file so you can prewiev what is all about.
